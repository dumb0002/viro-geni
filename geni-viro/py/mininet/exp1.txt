# File Format:
#   - lines starting with "#" are ignored
#   - empty lines are ignored
#   - edges are space separated e.g. "fromNode toNode"
#   -  each edge is in the form "vid1 vid2", which is and edges between two switches with ids vid1, and vid2
#
# NOTE: Don't add repeated edges i.e. If one line is "1 2", then don't add "2 1"
#
# The "mininet-exp.py" attaches to each switch one host and one local viro controller, in addition, each switch
# is connected to the remote viro controller. 
# Hosts uses dhcp to retrieve their ip address. So, make sure your remote controller is running a dhcp server.
